# Packet Tracer Projects

This repository serves as a portfolio of sorts to showcase my skills and knowledge in network setup and configuration, featuring labs I've created and simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer. This repository will regularly be updated whenever I work on a new lab scenario I create.

I also included a .DOCX file that documents each lab's scenario. If you don't have a document viewer, I also created a separate Google Docs document you can view [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fm94glsm_hrAz8Ze9UFr7jQ-dccMNf1szm4RK6rn5lE/edit?usp=sharing).
