# Packet Tracer Projects

This repository serves as a portfolio of sorts to showcase my skills and knowledge in network setup and configuration, featuring labs I've created and simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer. This repository will regularly be updated whenever I work on a new lab scenario I create.

Each lab would include a markdown file that documents the scenario of each lab, as well as the steps I took in order to setup and configure each lab.
